This is a modern tool to inject custom executable program code into Windows PC video games using memory manipulation and the Win32 API in C++.

I am currently in the processing of updating the code and modernizing it for more general purpose consumption by private users. The code in this repository probably will not compile properly until this process is complete. Please be patient and bear with me; the original code is fairly ugly and I would prefer to clean it up prior to committing it. However, if you insist on seeing the project in its original form, you may download it from [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/msz7wwsgwble4yu/Exodus%20MKIII.zip) in the form of a ZIP archive.

Features:

* Code Injection/Detours
* Keyboard Hooking
* User Extendable via Plugin Support
